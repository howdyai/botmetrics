## Updating your Heroku installation

1. Clone the repo to your local computer.
2. Setup a Heroku git remote for your local instance `heroku git:remote -a <your-app-name>`
3. For the first time, you will need to run `git push -f heroku master`
4. For subsequent updates, run `git pull --rebase origin master && git push heroku master`
5. Run `heroku run rake db:migrate` for database migrations that need to
   happen.

## Installation on your own Linux server

1. Make sure you have Ruby 2.3.1 installed along with Rubygems (make
   sure you have `libxslt-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libpq-dev` installed on
your machine).
2. Setup the `.env` file by running `cp .env-example .env`
3. Replace `JSON_WEB_TOKEN_SECRET` with your own randomized secret.
4. Replace `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` with URLs to your Postgres and Redis database URLs respectively. (Postgres and Redis can be on the same machine or different machines).
5. Run `./script/server` to start the server.

## Development

1. `cp .env-example .env`
2. Start Redis & Postgres (there's a `./script/redis` and
   `./script/dbstart` command that lets you do this easily)
3. Run `./script/dbreset` to reset the database (creates a new one,
   loads schema and runs `rake db:seed`)
4. Run `./script/server` to start the server
5. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deploying Botmetrics to AWS with Convox

[Convox](https://www.convox.com) is an easy way to deploy dockerized applications to [AWS](http://www.aws.com)

1. Sign up for Convox, Install a Rack and Convox CLI.
2. In your botmetrics directory issue the following commands:
   `convox apps create` to create an application called botmetrics
3. `convox services create postgres && convox services create redis` this will provision a Postgres and Redis Service on AWS (Go get a coffee.)
4. Once convox has finished creating the app you can start you first deploy with `convox deploy`
5. Set the environment variables for Redis and Postgres
   1. `convox services` will list the names of the postgres and redis service instances.
   2. `convox service info <service name>` will provide the URL for each service.
   3. Use `convox env set REDIS_URL=<url_from_redis_service>` and `convox env set DATABASE_URL=<url_from_redis_service>`
   4. Note the final release ID
6. After convox deploy from step 5 has finished promote the release with the ENV variables with `convox releases promote <release_id>`
7. Setup your database for the first time with `convox run web rake db:structure:load db:seed`
8. Get the public URL for your app with `convox apps info` it's the one that's on `port 80`
9. Browse to the URL and Enjoy!
